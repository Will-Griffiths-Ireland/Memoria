## **Planning Stage**

### **Planning Overview:**

My aim with the game was to create something simple and engaging for younger children to develop visual memory skills.

There are benefits to both children and adults when they engage in an activity that stimulates memory.
When planning Memoria I kept my focus on the player and making a memory game that had a really simple core gameplay loop, but had an increasing memory challenge factor.
My main aims for the game were…

* Clean interface to emulate a big tidy table
* Distinctive cards with the same ‘feel’ as regular playing cards
* Multiple themes for cards of different colours
* Easily rememberable icons
* Engaging animations that add to the player experience
* Progression in difficulty with rewards
* Storing player details, settings, and progression
* A super hard mode for the ultimate test


### **Target Audiences:**

* Children of any ability level
* Adults looking for a quick game with a challenge
* Adults with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's or dementia that can benefit from cognitive stimulation

### **User Stories:**

* As a player, I want to game to load quickly on my device
* As a player, I want a fun and engaging experience
* As a player, I want to have a clear objective that provides a challenge
* as a player, I want progression and reward
* as a user, I want to save my game settings
* as a user, I want options to configure the game specifically to me
* as a user, I want to configure the game to match my devices abilities
* as a user, I want quick access to control audio

### **Game Aims:**

* The game should, scale the interface to the users device
* The game should, allow user interface zoom and scale proportionally
* The game should, present the user with multiple game themes


### **Wireframes:**

### **Color Scheme:**

The star of the game is the cards and I've done my best to create vibrant assets with depth and character

## **Testing Phase**

Throughout development I thoroughly tested each piece of code from a core logic perspective and a visual one, before commits.
My approach to testing is to do everything I can, from an end user perspective, to break the application. Always expect the unexpected click!
Please note all testing code & comments were removed from final production code.
The general dev cycle testing procedure was..

* Add console logging for every variable
* Verify results of calculations were as expected
* Add console logging of all function executions and conditional tests
* Verify outcomes were as expected
* Using Chrome Devtools verify DOM manipulations were successful and as expected
 

A suite of final tests were performed once I felt the application was code complete.

| Test Type | Chrome(Windows) | Firefox(Windows) | Edge(windows) | Safari(IpadOS) | Chrome(Android) | Samsung Internet(Android) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Intro Screen Loads | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| Intro Screen has fluid rendering | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| Intro Screen continue button triggers user welcome | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |

### **Validators**

#### *HTML Validator*

Since nearly all the html is injected by Javascript the HTML validator does not have much to check

| File | Result | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| index.html | Pass | N\A |


#### *CSS Validator*

## **Defects**

Being a basic HTML/CSS site there were not many true bugs/defects from my testing phase.
I chalked most of my issues down to the learning process during development so didn't document them all.
