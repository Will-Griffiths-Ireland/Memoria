## **Planning Stage**

### **Planning Overview:**

My aim with the game was to create something simple and engaging for younger children to develop visual memory skills.

There are benefits to both children and adults when they engage in an activity that stimulates memory.
When planning Memoria I kept my focus on the player and making a memory game that had a really simple core gameplay loop, but had an increasing memory challenge factor.
My main aims for the game were…

* Clean interface to emulate a big tidy table
* Distinctive cards with the same ‘feel’ as regular playing cards
* Multiple themes for cards of different colours
* Easily rememberable icons
* Engaging animations that add to the player experience
* Progression in difficulty with rewards
* Storing player details, settings, and progression
* A super hard mode for the ultimate test


### **Target Audiences:**

* Children of any ability level
* Adults looking for a quick game with a challenge
* Adults with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's or dementia that can benefit from cognitive stimulation

### **User Stories:**

* As a user, I want to game to load quickly on my device
* As a user, I want a fun and engaging experience
* As a user, I want to have a clear objective that provides a challenge
* as a user, I want progression and reward
* as a user, I want to save my game settings
* as a user, I want to configure the game to match my devices abilities
* as a user, I want quick access to control audio

### **Game Aims:**

* The game should, display cleanly

## **Defects**

Being a basic HTML/CSS site there were not many true bugs/defects from my testing phase.
I chalked most of my issues down to the learning process during development so didn't document them all.
